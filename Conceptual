1. AI for Edge Computing

Definition of Edge Computing:
Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm where data processing occurs near the source of data generation rather than relying on a centralized cloud server.

How AI Enhances Edge Computing:
AI enables real-time data analysis at the edge, reducing latency, enhancing security, and minimizing bandwidth usage.

Example - AI-Powered Edge Computing in Autonomous Vehicles:
Self-driving cars use AI-based edge computing to process sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) in real-time, allowing quick decision-making without relying on cloud servers. This ensures low-latency responses for navigation and collision avoidance.


2. AI and IoT Integration

How AI Enhances IoT in Smart Homes:
AI processes data collected from IoT devices, enabling automation, personalization, and energy efficiency in smart home systems.

Example - AI-Powered Smart Thermostat (Google Nest):
Google Nest uses AI to analyze user preferences and sensor data, automatically adjusting temperature settings for optimal comfort and energy savings.

Benefits:

Reduces energy consumption

Improves comfort through predictive automation

Learns user habits for personalized settings

3. AI and IoB (Internet of Bodies)

Definition of IoB (Internet of Bodies):
IoB refers to the network of smart devices worn or implanted in the human body that collect and transmit health-related data.

How AI Enhances IoB in Healthcare:
AI analyzes real-time biometric data to detect health anomalies, enabling early disease detection and personalized treatment.

Example - AI-Powered Pacemakers:
Smart pacemakers use AI to monitor heart rhythms, predict abnormalities, and adjust pacing accordingly.

Benefits:

Real-time heart monitoring

Early detection of cardiac issues

Remote health management for doctors
